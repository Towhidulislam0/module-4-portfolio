            <h3> Become a web developer</h3>
            <p>
                As a young child, my dream occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I grew older and my interests changed,
                my dream profession changed also. Although most of these dreams were not very long lived, one
                occupational dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I passionately
                pursue.It all started when my grandparents purchased their first computer. Being as this was the first
                computer I had ever used, I did not know how to use it very well. I mostly used it for games, which my
                grandma would set up for me to play. I also drew pictures with the computer's paint program, the
                functionality of which, unfortunately, was very limited. The relatively new computer industry's
                technology could not produce enough colors to portray very realistic pictures. Despite this fact, I
                spent many contented hours creating images on my grandparent's computer.

                <p>
                    I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.The full
                    stack developer definition is “someone who can work on both the back-end and front-end of systems.”
                    This means that they can develop fully fledged platforms (with databases, servers and clients) which
                    don’t need other applications to function.

                <p>
                    First, let me introduce myself. My name is Sergei Garcia, and I’m a full-time front end developer
                    with 2 years experience. In that time, I’ve worked as a front-end developer for both a Forbes 500
                    consulting firm and a small company.This may not sound like a lot of experience, but finishing my
                    second year as a developer has been a huge milestone for me. This is because I had no real
                    experience doing web development — and not much programming experience in general beyond some basic
                    C# and Java training I got from a few online courses.
